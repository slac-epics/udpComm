udpComm-R1-3-0:  (2010/06/01, T.S.)
		 Just another module-jungle release.
		 Built against event-R3-2-1 instead of event-R3-2-0.

udpComm-R1-3-0:  (2010/05/24, T.S.) This release adds a few diagnostics:
                  * 'padStream' statistics counters reporting how
                    many stream packets were sent, how often the stream
                    timestamp is updated and recording the max. delay
                    between updates.
                  
udpComm-R1-2-0:  (2010/04/23, T.S.) This release fixes bugs:
                  * udpComm packet payload is NOT ALIGNED
                    to the boundary promised by
                    udpComm.h: UDPCOMM_ALIGNMENT
                    In reality, the payload is at a well-known
                    offset from an alignment boundary.
                    To clarify this and force users who used
                    UDPCOMM_ALIGNMENT this symbol was *removed*
                    and replace ty UDPCOMM_DATA_ALGN_OFF and
                    UDPCOMM_DATA_ALGN which define the offset from
                    and the alignment boundary, respectively.

                  * padStreamStart() would often fail immediately
                    after a successful padStreamStart(). This was
                    because recent lanIpBasic only asynchronously
                    updates the ARP cache. FIXED by internally creating
                    an ARP cache entry.

                 Enhancements:
 
                  * Added rudimentary drvPadUdpComm documentation:
                    README.drvPadUdpComm; additional documentation is
                    in the form of more detailed comments in header files.
