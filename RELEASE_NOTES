udpComm-R2-1-4:  (2011/Sept/27, Ernest)
                 - Build against event module version: event-R3-2-2-br_generaltime-1-2
                   the new event module now supports EVRs under linux
udpComm-R2-1-3:  (2011/Aug/04, Till)
               - Added fix for run-time test (whether post-3.14.9 EVR code is patched);
                 see ChangeLog for details.
udpComm-R2-1-2:  (2011/Aug/03, Ernest)
                 - Build against event module version: event-R3-2-2-br_generaltime-1-1
udpComm-R2-1-1:  (2011/Jun/06, Till)

               - drvPadUdpComm.c: defined TS1_OR_4_TIME for post- base-3.14.9 (bundled
                 generalTime) where we use epicsTimeEventBestTime (== -1). However,
                 this requires evrTimeGet():event/evrTime.c to be modified. Added a
                 run-time check for this modification and fail driver initialization
                 if the check doesn't pass.
               - fidProcess.c, wavBuf.c, devWfRawSig.c: include <errlog.h> to silence
                 compiler warnings under base-3.14.12

udpComm-R2-1-0:  (2011/May/09, Till)

                  o several bug-fixes to new features as well as more new
				    features (fragmented streams).
udpComm-R2-0-0:  (2011/April/22, Till)
                 Several enhancements in order to better support LLRF needs.
                  o drvPadUdpComm is data 'kind' agnostic and supports up to
                    8 kinds as defined by the padProto.
                  o new option to support streaming only a single channel
                    (instead of the normal 4).
                  o support packet reference count so that a single packet
                    can be shared by multiple threads and free'd only when
                    the last user releases it.
                  o preparation for better support for multi-index (= fragmented)
                    streams.
                 Since these changes required modifications to the padProtocol
                 the major release version was bumped. 
udpComm-R1-3-2:  (2011/April/05, Ernesto)
                 Changes to decouple the version of EPICS BASE from the configure/RELEASE
                 Everything is essentially done in the RELEASE_SITE file now.
                 

udpComm-R1-3-1:  (2010/06/01, T.S.)
		 Just another module-jungle release.
		 Built against event-R3-2-1 instead of event-R3-2-0.

udpComm-R1-3-0:  (2010/05/24, T.S.) This release adds a few diagnostics:
                  * 'padStream' statistics counters reporting how
                    many stream packets were sent, how often the stream
                    timestamp is updated and recording the max. delay
                    between updates.
                  
udpComm-R1-2-0:  (2010/04/23, T.S.) This release fixes bugs:
                  * udpComm packet payload is NOT ALIGNED
                    to the boundary promised by
                    udpComm.h: UDPCOMM_ALIGNMENT
                    In reality, the payload is at a well-known
                    offset from an alignment boundary.
                    To clarify this and force users who used
                    UDPCOMM_ALIGNMENT this symbol was *removed*
                    and replace ty UDPCOMM_DATA_ALGN_OFF and
                    UDPCOMM_DATA_ALGN which define the offset from
                    and the alignment boundary, respectively.

                  * padStreamStart() would often fail immediately
                    after a successful padStreamStart(). This was
                    because recent lanIpBasic only asynchronously
                    updates the ARP cache. FIXED by internally creating
                    an ARP cache entry.

                 Enhancements:
 
                  * Added rudimentary drvPadUdpComm documentation:
                    README.drvPadUdpComm; additional documentation is
                    in the form of more detailed comments in header files.
